# 📚 Academic Planner Web App

A dynamic academic task management system that enables students to organize courses, track assignments, manage deadlines, and monitor progress.

This project demonstrates structured data modeling, nested objects, localStorage persistence, dashboard analytics, and dynamic UI rendering using vanilla JavaScript.

- Add and delete assignments under each course
- Set assignment deadlines
- Mark assignments as completed
- Real-time dashboard summary (Total / Completed / Pending)
- Persistent data storage using localStorage
- Dynamic DOM rendering
- Responsive and clean UI design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, modern UI styling)
- JavaScript (ES6)

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Nested data structures (Courses → Assignments)
- State management
- Conditional rendering
- Dashboard analytics logic
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Persistent client-side storage
- Event-driven programming

## Project Structure
